This code was stolen from [R2D2BC](https://github.com/d-i-t-a/R2D2BC/releases/tag/2.1.1) and adapted slightly to work with dynamicly sized texts.

There were incompatibilities with the original code that I was unable to manage in a generic manner, so we had to make some changes.

See github for changes and the license.
