# Pinned deps

"@crxjs/vite-plugin": "1.0.13", due to https://github.com/crxjs/chrome-extension-tools/pull/465 - actually the bug maybe only affects the dev server, and appears to work fine in the built extension. It is a bit annoying that the dev server doesn't work, but it's not a big deal.

"react-player": "2.10.1", due to https://github.com/cookpete/react-player/issues/1508
